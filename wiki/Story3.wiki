#summary Paul visits his own profile (random)

_DRAFT_

= Introduction =

Assumption: Paul has set his VisitME preference to random friends.

On a beautiful summer morning, Paul logs into his facebook profile to check updates from his friends. He has a small VisitME box where he can see how much it would cost to visit his friend which is displayed in the box randomly from his friendlist. The VisitME box is refreshed every 10 seconds and gives him a quote to visit his friend. 

Paul finds that there is an event invitation from his friend Jim in Las Vegas for his 1st Marriage Anniversary Party. At the same time, VisitME displays the cost to visit Jim in LA which is $175 and it is 40% less than regular air ticket to LA. He decides to attend the party, so he follows the link to Kayak.com and plans his round trip to LA to attend
