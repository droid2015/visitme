Risk Analysis

= People =

== Client unavailable (sick) ==

||		||Probability	||Severity	||Possible solution||
||Two weeks	||5/10		||0/10		||Postphone client meetings||
||Until May	||0/10		||4/10		||We can communicate with the client remotely, or if they really can't communicate we will contact other people at Kayak that know what we are doing.||
  
== Client unavailable (leaves Kayak) ==
    * Probability: 0/10
	* Severity: 8/10
	* Possible solution: We will be left without a client, but we can continue the project independently, since Kayak API is open.

== Client doesn't want VisitME ==
    * Probability: 2/10
	* Severity: 2/10
    * Possible solution
	  * Default: Client will give us another project to do.
	  * No more projects: We will be left without a client, but we can continue the project independently, since Kayak API is open.
	 
== Team (sick) ==

||			||Probability	||Severity	||Possible solution||
||1 person	||10/10			||1/10		||Reassign tasks to other team members or reschedule.	||
||1 role	||4/10			||6/10		||Reschedule tasks until at least one person on the role is available.	||
||Whole Team||1/10			||10/10		||Reschedule until each role has one person to do it.	||
