#summary Summary of the deployment of VisitMe
#labels Phase-Deploy

= Server requirements =
We are not going into hardware requirements since that will vary based on how much power application needs.

  * Web Server: Apache
  * PHP 5.2.X+
  * MySQL
  * FTP Access
  * Open on Port 80
  * Static IP address

== Hosting ==

We currently believe that hosting the application on a machine at Kayak, if possible, would be a vastly superior alternative to using a third party hosting solution on the grounds that it would be more reliable and easier to access.

*Update*:
Kayak has agreed to provide us with a server to host VisitMe.
