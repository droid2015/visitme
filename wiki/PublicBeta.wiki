#summary Description of how we will go public

= Introduction =
Any application on a social network is pointless if people do not use it. It is for this reason that we will have to get as many people as possible to test VisitMe.

= Details =
While the temptation is strong to let people try it out as soon as we have _anything_ running, there are several things that must be done before we can deploy the application to more users:

  * Application must be relatively stable
  * The core functionality must be complete
  * We need to make sure we have access rights to make a large number of API calls
  * We need a way to keep track of how many people are using the application
  * User feedback
