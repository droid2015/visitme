#summary Jim visits Paul's profile
#labels Phase-Requirements

= Introduction =

As usual, Jim opened Firefox and logged in to Facebook to check his friends' news in the morning. The first news feed in his homepage was from his college roommate Paul, it said "Paul is missing all his old friends". Jim smiled and responded, "Hey, dude, I miss you too". 

Jim clicked Paul's name to his profile page. He viewed Paul's newly added photos of his trip to Santa Barbara. And suddenly, he found a box on the left column of Paul's profile page, just below the information box. It displayed "VisitME - You can visit Paul for $188". "Interesting", Jim thought, as he saw the lowest fare to fly from Durham, NC to Boston, MA is $188 on Nov. 13th. 

Jim checked his schedule and found that November 13th is a Friday and he would be free that weekend, "hmm... I haven't seen Paul since graduation, maybe it's a good time to visit him", so he followed the link to Kayak.com and booked a round-trip to Boston.
