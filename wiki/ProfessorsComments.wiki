#summary Space for Professor Bolker to inform the team of how awesome it is.

November 2.

I see lots of new functionality requested at the October 30 client meeting. Do those all go into your first release? Consider maintaining a list of requested features in a single place so that you can prioritize and schedule them.

October 27.

The use case for Story6 doesn't seem to me to match the sample UI. The former calls for much more information than the latter has fields for.

Use cases should be separate from short stories (since one use case may be part of several stories, and a story may need more than one use case). You should also use a more traditional template, in which the user's actions and the system's responses are clearly separate.

October 22. I like the CodingGuidelines. You acknowledge that they're a customization of some you got from PHPBB. You should link to the original, and perhaps write a few words about the changes you made, and why.

Do you have a plan to enforce these guidelines?

October 20. Why have dates in Hello World on the schedule been changed to WOC (waiting on client)? I can see why you might need that for the Kayak API, but for a simple facebook app hello world?

You should probably have dates even for the items that depend on things beyond your control (like client input) so you can record when you need or expect them by. That way you can track their effects on the rest of your schedule.

October 2. You are awesome.

October 2. I think your schedule should distinguish between major milestones and the intermediate milestones along the way. Perhaps color or font could do that without too much trouble. And you should schedule a few more of the major milestones so the schedule reaches out more than just a week or two.
